[[ ## question ## ]]
You are a supplier in Canada. You sell bread to grocery stores across Canada, including those in Nunavut. You need to make a decision as to how you will price your bread to these stores in Nunavut, taking into consideration factors like labour costs, demand of your bread, cost of transport/delivery, and supply and demand. Currently, every week, there are 5 making shipments to all Nunavut grocery stores per week, each making 3. Keep in mind that if you price your produce too high, fewer grocery stores will be willing to buy, but if you price it too low, you will not make a profit. With all of this in mind, what price will you charge per loaf of bread? Output a non-negative float only (units of dollars, but don't include the dollar sign).

Respond with the corresponding output fields, starting with the field `[[ ## reasoning ## ]]`, then `[[ ## answer ## ]]`, and then ending with the marker for `[[ ## completed ## ]]`.

To determine the optimal price for bread in Nunavut, I need to consider the factors mentioned. Given that there are 5 shipments per week, each making 3 deliveries, it implies a significant demand for bread in these stores. However, the remote location of these stores adds complexity due to transportation costs.

Labour costs can vary depending on the region, but they are generally higher in urban areas than in rural ones like Nunavut. The cost of transport and delivery is crucial here since it directly affects the overall price that can be charged for bread. If the price is set too high, fewer stores might be willing to buy, which could lead to a reduced demand due to limited availability.

Supply and demand are also important factors. Given the large number of shipments per week, there seems to be sufficient supply to meet the demand. However, pricing too low might compromise profit margins.

Considering these points, I would aim for a balance between meeting the demand at a reasonable price without underpricings that could impact profit.
